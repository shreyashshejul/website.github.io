## 1. Introduction

### Purpose

This document serves as a guide for understanding and managing the website created for our business. It outlines the technologies used, design decisions, and instructions for running or deploying the website.

### Technologies Used

The website is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML:** For creating the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS:** For styling and design.
- **Web Hosting (GitHub Pages):** For deploying the website.

## 2. Design Decisions

### Website Layout

The website follows a standard layout structure with a header, main content area, and a footer for consistency and ease of navigation.

### Responsive Design

The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing across various devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) using media queries and flexible layouts.

### SEO

To improve search engine visibility, the website employs proper HTML structure and meta tags. Keyword optimization is done for better search results.

### Navigation

The header and footer are consistent across all pages, providing easy navigation throughout the website.

## 3. Website Structure

### HTML Files

The website consists of several HTML files:

- `index.html`: The homepage.
- `services.html`: The services listing page.
- Individual service pages (e.g., `service1.html`, `service2.html`).

### CSS Styles

CSS styles are stored in a separate `css` folder. A `style.css` file contains the website's styling.

### Images

Images used in the website are stored in the `images` folder. These include service thumbnails and other graphical elements.

---

## 4. Functionality

### Homepage

The homepage introduces the business and features a primary service.

### Services Page

The services page lists multiple services with thumbnail images and descriptions. Clicking on a service opens a separate page with more details.

### Individual Service Pages

Each service has its own HTML file containing detailed information.

### Contact Page

The contact page includes a form with fields for name, email, subject, file attachment, and message, with validation. PHP (or another server-side language) may be used to handle form submissions and file uploads.

1. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub (or your source code repository).
2. Open the project folder on your local machine.
3. Double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in a web browser.

## 6. Deploying the Website

To deploy the website to a live server, follow these steps:

1. Choose a web hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, a traditional web host).
2. Upload your website files to the hosting server using FTP or version control.
3. Configure domain settings, if necessary, and ensure your website is accessible online.

## 7. Maintenance and Updates

- Regularly update the content, services, and images to keep the website current.
- Ensure security measures are in place, especially for handling user data and file uploads.
- Keep the website code and plugins (if any) up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.
